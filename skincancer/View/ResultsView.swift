It often presents as a new mole or a change in an existing mole, following the ABCDE rule: Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter larger than 6mm, and Evolving shape or color. Early detection is critical, as melanoma can spread to other parts of the body if not caught early. Treatment options may include surgical removal, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or radiation, depending on the stage of the disease."
